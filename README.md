> **Automatic offset mapping tool for Unity IL2CPP dumps** 🚀

When your Unity game updates and all your precious offsets become invalid... 😿

*Me trying to manually update hundreds of offsets after game update*

## 🌟 Features

- ✨ **Smart Signature Matching**: Maps old offsets to new ones based on method signatures
- 🧹 **Clean Parsing**: Removes compiler-generated noise from signatures  
- 📊 **Progress Tracking**: Beautiful progress bars powered by Rich
- 🎯 **Batch Processing**: Process entire files with hundreds of offsets at once
- 🔍 **Detailed Results**: Shows exactly what was mapped and what wasn't found

## 🛠️ Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/traitimtrongvag/GetOFFSET.git
cd GetOFFSET

# Install dependencies
pip install rich
```

## 📋 Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- `rich` library for beautiful console output

## 🚀 Usage

### Quick Start

1. **Prepare your files:**
   - `dump_old.cs` - Your old IL2CPP dump file
   - `dump.cs` - Your new IL2CPP dump file  
   - `INPUT.txt` - File containing your old offsets

2. **Run the tool:**
```bash
python main.py
```

3. **Follow the prompts:**
```
Enter old dump file (default dump_old.cs): 
Enter new dump file (default dump.cs):
```

4. **Get your results in `OUTPUT.txt`** ✨

### File Structure
```
GetOFFSET/
│
├── main.py           # Main script
├── INPUT.txt         # Your input file with old offsets
├── OUTPUT.txt        # Generated output with new offsets
├── dump_old.cs       # Old IL2CPP dump
├── dump.cs           # New IL2CPP dump
└── README.md         # This file
```

## 📝 Input Format

Your `INPUT.txt` can contain offsets in any format:
```cpp
// Example C++ code
void* someFunction = (void*)0x12345678;
int offset = 0xABCDEF00;
// Mixed with other content...
```

## 📤 Output

The tool will:
- Replace all old offsets with new ones in `OUTPUT.txt`
- Show detailed mapping results in console:

```
=== Mapping result ===
0x12345678 -> 0x87654321   [PlayerController] Update()
0xABCDEF00 -> 0x00FEDCBA   [GameManager] Start()
0x11111111 -> NOT FOUND in dump
```

*When all offsets are successfully mapped* 🎉

## 🔧 How It Works

1. **Parse Old Dump**: Extracts class names, method signatures, and their offsets
2. **Parse New Dump**: Creates a mapping from signatures to new offsets  
3. **Smart Matching**: Uses cleaned signatures to find corresponding methods
4. **Batch Replace**: Updates all offsets in your input file

### Signature Cleaning

The tool automatically cleans compiler-generated patterns:
```cpp
// Before cleaning
public void Update() b__123_456; // 0x12345678

// After cleaning  
public void Update() // 0x12345678
```

## 🎭 Why This Tool Exists

Because manually updating offsets is like trying to teach a cat to code...
